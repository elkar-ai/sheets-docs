## How Your Data Flows

<Steps>
  <Step title="Data Processing">
    When you interact with Elkar, your spreadsheet data is:

    - **Encrypted** before leaving your device
    - **Processed** in real-time on secure servers
    - **Analyzed** by our AI orchestration layer
    - **Returned** with results to your spreadsheet
    - **Never used **for re-training
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Deletion">
    After processing:

    - **Spreadsheet content** is immediately deleted
    - **Zero data retention** beyond active session
    - **No conversation history** stored
    - **Processing logs** contain no sensitive data
    - **Results** are delivered directly to your Excel/GSheets
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optional Chat History">
    If enabled, only conversation text is stored:

    - Conversation text**encrypted and stored** 
    - Access previous conversations across sessions
    - **Can be disabled and deleted** anytime from [dashboard settings](https://sheets-app.elkar.co/settings)
  </Step>
</Steps>
