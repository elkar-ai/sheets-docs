## Data & Privacy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Are all requests routed through Elkar?">
    Yes, even if you use your own API key, requests are routed through Elkar's backend. This is where we:

    - Build optimized prompts for better results
    - Coordinate agent-based task execution
    - Ensure consistent, high-quality outputs
    - Route intelligently across different models

    Think of it as a conductor orchestrating your AI workflow for the best possible experience.

## Technical Support

  <Accordion title="Elkar isn't responding to my prompts">
    **Try these steps:**

    - Be more specific with your requests (include column names, desired outputs)
    - Check your internet connection
    - If your data is very large, Elkar may time out: Try simplifying or splitting your request
    - It could also be a temporary issue with our AI provider: Try selecting a different LLM in the settings or refreshing your session
