## Core Security Principles

### Privacy-First Architecture

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="No Data Storage" icon="database">
    **Your data is never permanently stored.** All spreadsheet content is processed in real-time and automatically deleted after each request.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Encryption in Transit" icon="lock">
    **All data is encrypted** using TLS 1.2 or higher during transmission between your device and our servers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="LLM-Agnostic" icon="star">
    **Choose your AI provider.** Select from OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Gemini, or bring your own API key.
  </Card>
  <Card title="LLM Protection" icon="handshake">
    **Our partnerships** ensure your data is never used for AI model training by any provider.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How Your Data Flows

<Steps>
  <Step title="Data Processing">
    When you interact with Elkar, your spreadsheet data is:

    - **Encrypted** before leaving your device
    - **Processed** in real-time on secure servers
    - **Analyzed** by our AI orchestration layer
    - **Returned** with results to your spreadsheet
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Deletion">
    After processing:

    - **Spreadsheet content** is immediately deleted
    - **No copies** are retained on our servers
    - **Processing logs** contain no sensitive data
    - **Results** are delivered directly to your Excel/Sheets
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optional Chat History">
    If enabled, only conversation text is stored:

    - **Encrypted** conversation history
    - **No spreadsheet data** included
    - **User-controlled** deletion options
    - **Can be disabled** anytime
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)
