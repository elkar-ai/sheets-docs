## Step 1: Start Your First Conversation

Open Elkar and tell it what you want to accomplish. Use natural language - no special commands needed.

### Try These Starter Prompts:

- What insights can you find in my data?
- Calculate profit margin as a percentage
- Build a chart of monthly sales per region
- Find duplicate entries in my customer list
- Build a P&L forecast for Q3 with adjustable revenue growth and operating expenses

## Step 2: Watch Elkar Work

Elkar scans understand context and makes changes in real-time based on your request. You'll see the process step by step.

<Note>
  **Elkar's Unique Advantage**: Unlike general AI tools, Elkar can see across multiple sheets simultaneously and understands Spreadsheets-specific concepts like cell references, formulas, and data relationships.
</Note>

## Step 3: Keep the Conversation Going

You can work with Elkar in two ways:

- Have a natural conversation to guide the analysis step by step
- Mix Elkarâ€™s AI with your own Excel edits, letting the AI handle the complex tasks while you keep full control

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AI Conversation Flow">
    With Elkar's Chat you can iterate and build sophisticated analysis through natural dialogue. **Example conversation:**

    - **You:** "Analyze my sales data"
    - **Elkar:** \_Provides insights and trends \_
    - **You:** "Create a forecast for next quarter"
    - **Elkar:** _Builds forecast based on the analysis_
    - **You:** "What if we increase marketing spend by 30%?"
    - **Elkar:** _Adjusts forecast with new assumptions_
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Hybrid Approach">
    Combine AI assistance with manual Excel work for maximum flexibility:

    - Let Elkar create the initial structure
    - Manually adjust formatting to your preferences
    - Ask Elkar to analyze your manual additions
    - Use AI for complex calculations, manual editing for presentation
  </Tab>
