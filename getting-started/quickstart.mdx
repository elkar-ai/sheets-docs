## What Sets Elkar Apart

<AccordionGroup>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What about Microsoft Copilot in Excel?">
    **Advanced Capabilities:** Elkar offers specialized features like cross-sheet error detection, deep financial modeling (e.g., LBO, Monte Carlo, DCF), and **Plan Mode** for scenario planning and strategic analysis.
