## **Power Prompting Key Principles**

**Specific financial context** gets you better models. Elkar understands finance - use the right terminology and be precise about your assumptions.

## Good vs. Bad Financial Prompts

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="DCF Models">
    ❌ **Vague:** _"Build a DCF model"_

    ✅ **Specific:** _"Build a 5-year DCF model for a SaaS company with current revenue of \$50M, 25% growth rate declining to 15%, and 20% EBITDA margins expanding to 30%"_

    **Why it works:** Timeframe, company type, key assumptions, growth trajectory
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Forecasting">
    ❌ **Generic:** _"Create a revenue forecast"_

    ✅ **Detailed:** _"Build bottom-up revenue forecast: 1,000 customers growing 15% annually, average price \$5,000 increasing 3% yearly, churn rate 8%"_

    **Why it works:** Unit economics, growth drivers, specific metrics
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Valuation">
    ❌ **Unclear:** _"Value this company"_

    ✅ **Precise:** _"Create comparable company analysis with EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, P/E multiples for software companies with 100M revenue"_

    **Why it works:** Methodology, metrics, peer group definition
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="LBO">
    ❌ **Too broad:** _"Create an LBO model"_

    ✅ **Comprehensive:** _"Build LBO model: \$100M purchase price, 60% debt at 7% interest, 5-year hold period, exit at 10x EBITDA, target 25% IRR"_

    **Why it works:** Purchase price, leverage ratio, debt terms, hold period, exit assumptions, return targets
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="M&A">
    ❌ **Ambiguous:** _"Analyze this merger"_

    ✅ **Structured:** _"Create accretion/dilution analysis: acquirer at 20x P/E, target at 15x P/E, 30% cash/70% stock deal, \$50M synergies over 3 years"_

    **Why it works:** Deal structure, valuation multiples, consideration mix, synergy assumptions, timeline
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Use Financial Terminology

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Margins & Growth" icon="arrow-up-right-dots">
    ✅ _"EBITDA margins expanding 200bps annually"_

    ✅ _"Net working capital as % of revenue"_
  </Card>
  <Card title="Valuation & Returns" icon="dollar-sign">
    ✅ _"Terminal value using exit multiple of 12x EBITDA"_

    ✅ _"WACC of 10% with 30% debt/equity ratio"_
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  **Pro tip:** Start simple with core assumptions, then layer in complexity. Each prompt should build on the previous structure.

## Live Demo: Building a DCF

### **Get Advanced DCF Prompt**

Build a full, professional-grade DCF model for a SaaS company with monthly forecasts over 2 years. Include detailed assumptions (subscription revenue by cohort, churn, CAC, headcount ramp, salaries, margins, taxes, capex, working capital). Structure the model across cleanly separated sheets: Inputs, Monthly Forecast, Free Cash Flow, Valuation (with both perpetuity and exit multiple), Sensitivity Analysis, and a Summary Dashboard with charts (FCF, valuation waterfall, CAC payback). Format using standard financial modeling best practices: clean layout, blue input cells, consistent formatting, borders, and named ranges. Include transparent formulas, dynamic links to Inputs, and annotate key calculations for clarity like in investment banking models
