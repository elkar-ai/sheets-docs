ChatGPT requires you to copy-paste data and can't make direct changes to your files. **Spreadsheets Expertise:** Purpose-built for spreadsheet workflows with deep understanding of formulas, data structures, and Excel/GSheets best practices.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What about Microsoft Copilot in Excel?">
    **Advanced Capabilities:** Elkar offers specialized features like cross-sheet error detection, deep financial modeling (e.g., LBO, Monte Carlo, DCF), and **Plan Mode** for scenario planning and strategic analysis.
