## How It Works

## How to Use

1. **Upload your PDF** - Click on the "Upload PDF" icon on the bottom right
2. **Ask Elkar what to do**\
   You can choose from built-in prompts or write your own request: :
   - _“Extract all information from this document.”_
   - _“Fill in one row per document using the existing column headers.”_
   - _“Complete the missing cells in this table.”_
3. **Get results -** Elkar scans, maps relationships, and delivers formatted and organized data instantly

<Tip>
  **Pro tip:** Works best with structured PDFs (tables, reports). For scanned documents, ensure text is clear and readable.
