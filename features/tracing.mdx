## How It Works

1. **Click on any cell** with a formula you want to understand
2. **Hit "Trace"** and **click the \+** on the right
3. **Explore** the explanation and **retrace** every sub-calculations

<Tip>
  **Pro tip:** Use formula tracing when taking over someone else's spreadsheet. It's like having the original builder explain their work.
